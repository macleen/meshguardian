# Node Monitor Module

## Purpose
The Node Monitor module continuously oversees the health and status of nodes in the network. It detects issues like node failures or performance degradation and triggers alerts for timely intervention. This is crucial for maintaining network reliability, especially in dynamic environments like crisis zones or IoT systems.

## Interfaces
- **start_monitoring()**  
  - Purpose: Initiates continuous monitoring of all network nodes.  
  - Parameters: None.  
  - Behavior: Loops indefinitely, checking node statuses at regular intervals and triggering alerts for problematic nodes.  

- **get_node_status(node_id)**  
  - Purpose: Retrieves the current status of a specified node.  
  - Parameters:  
    - node_id: Identifier of the node to check.  
  - Returns:  
    - "active" if the node is functioning normally.  
    - "degraded" if the node is operational but underperforming.  
    - "inactive" if the node is down.  
    - "unknown" if the node cannot be found.  

- **alert_on_failure(node_id)**  
  - Purpose: Triggers an alert when a node failure or degradation is detected.  
  - Parameters:  
    - node_id: Identifier of the problematic node.  
  - Behavior: Logs the event and notifies administrators; additional recovery actions can be added.  

## Depends On
- **Node Registry**: Provides the list of nodes to monitor (e.g., network_nodes).  
- **Health Check Functions**: Includes is_node_active and is_node_degraded to assess node health.  
- **Logging and Notification Utilities**: Supports log_event and notify_admins for alerts.  

## Called By
- **Network Management System**: Invokes start_monitoring to begin the monitoring process.  
- **Monitoring Dashboard**: May call get_node_status for real-time status updates.  

## Used By
- **Network Maintenance Tools**: Relies on this module to detect and respond to node issues.  
- **Automated Recovery Systems**: Uses alerts to initiate failover or recovery procedures.  

## Used In
- **Crisis Response Networks**: Ensures node reliability in critical, high-stakes environments.  
- **IoT Systems**: Monitors sensor nodes to maintain consistent data flow.  

## Pseudocode
```pseudo-code

// Pseudo-code Implementation
FUNCTION start_monitoring()
    // Begin continuous monitoring of all nodes
    WHILE True
        FOR each node IN network_nodes
            status = CALL get_node_status(node.id)
            IF status == "inactive" OR status == "degraded"
                CALL alert_on_failure(node.id)
        WAIT_FOR_INTERVAL(monitor_interval)  // e.g., every 5 seconds

FUNCTION get_node_status(node_id)
    // Retrieve the current status of the specified node
    node = CALL find_node_by_id(node_id)
    IF node IS NULL
        RETURN "unknown"
    ELSE
        // Check node health (e.g., ping, resource usage)
        IF CALL is_node_active(node)
            RETURN "active"
        ELSE IF CALL is_node_degraded(node)
            RETURN "degraded"
        ELSE
            RETURN "inactive"

FUNCTION alert_on_failure(node_id)
    // Trigger an alert when a node failure is detected
    CALL log_event("Node failure detected: " + node_id)
    CALL notify_admins("Node " + node_id + " has failed")
    // Additional actions, e.g., reroute traffic, initiate recovery
```

## Notes
- **Monitoring Interval**: The WAIT_FOR_INTERVAL function controls how often nodes are checked (e.g., every 5 seconds). Adjust this based on system needs and performance constraints.  
- **Real-Time Updates**: For more responsive monitoring, consider event-driven checks instead of periodic polling.  
- **Scalability**: In large networks, optimize the status check loop to avoid performance bottlenecks.  
- **Customization**: The health check logic (is_node_active, is_node_degraded) should be tailored to the specific criteria for node health in the system.  
- **Error Handling**: Ensure that failures in monitoring (e.g., inability to reach a node) are logged and handled gracefully.
