# PoS Validation Module

## Purpose
The PoS Validation module is designed to validate blocks, transactions, and validator stakes within a Proof of Stake (PoS) consensus system. It ensures that all proposed blocks and transactions meet the necessary criteria for inclusion in the blockchain, verifying the stake-based authority of validators and maintaining the integrity of the ledger. This module is essential for decentralized systems that rely on stake-weighted voting to achieve consensus, providing security and efficiency without the energy demands of Proof of Work.

## Interfaces
- **validate_block(block)**: Verifies the structure, transactions, and stake-based consensus of a proposed block.  
- **verify_transaction(transaction)**: Validates individual transactions for correctness, ensuring they adhere to staking rules and balance constraints.  
- **check_validator_stake(validator, block)**: Confirms that a validator has sufficient stake to propose or vote on a block.  

## Depends On
- **/pseudo-code/crypto/signature.md**: Provides cryptographic functions to verify transaction and block signatures.  
- **/pseudo-code/consensus/pos_state.md**: Supplies the current state of the PoS system, including validator stakes and slashing conditions.  
- **/pseudo-code/blockchain/ledger.md**: Manages access to the blockchain ledger for balance checks and transaction history.  

## Called By
- **/pseudo-code/consensus/pos_main.md**: Invokes this module during the core PoS consensus process to validate blocks and transactions.  
- **/pseudo-code/application_layer/block_proposer.md**: Uses this module to ensure proposed blocks meet validation criteria before broadcasting.  

## Used In
- **Use Case 5.15: Aid Relays**: Validates staking-based consensus for supply tracking in crisis zones, ensuring tamper-proof data.  
- **Use Case 5.16: Emergency Chat**: Supports stake-weighted voting for message ordering and delivery in real-time communication systems.  

## Pseudocode
```pseudo-code
/// Function to validate a proposed block
FUNCTION validate_block(block)
    // Check block structure and header
    IF NOT is_valid_block_structure(block)
        RETURN False
    // Validate Feature Flags
    feature_flags = block.feature_flags
    IF feature_flags BIT 13 AND feature_flags BIT 24 THEN
        RETURN False  // ML Protocol Selection (Bit 13) not allowed in Low-Energy Mode (Bit 24)
    END IF
    IF feature_flags BIT 14 AND feature_flags BIT 24 THEN
        RETURN False  // ML Failure Prediction (Bit 14) not allowed in Low-Energy Mode (Bit 24)
    END IF
    // Verify block’s proposer has sufficient stake
    proposer = block.proposer
    IF NOT check_validator_stake(proposer, block)
        RETURN False
    // Validate each transaction in the block
    FOR each tx IN block.transactions
        IF NOT verify_transaction(tx)
            RETURN False
    // Verify block signature
    public_key = GET_PROPOSER_PUBLIC_KEY(proposer)
    IF NOT verify_signature(block.signature, block.content, public_key)
        RETURN False
    RETURN True

// Function to verify a transaction
FUNCTION verify_transaction(transaction)
    // Check transaction structure
    IF NOT is_valid_transaction_structure(transaction)
        RETURN False
    // Verify sender has sufficient balance or stake
    sender_balance = GET_SENDER_BALANCE(transaction.sender)
    IF sender_balance < transaction.amount
        RETURN False
    // Verify transaction signature
    public_key = GET_SENDER_PUBLIC_KEY(transaction.sender)
    IF NOT verify_signature(transaction.signature, transaction.content, public_key)
        RETURN False
    RETURN True

// Function to check a validator’s stake for block proposal or voting
FUNCTION check_validator_stake(validator, block)
    required_stake = CALCULATE_REQUIRED_STAKE(block)
    validator_stake = GET_VALIDATOR_STAKE(validator)
    IF validator_stake >= required_stake
        RETURN True
    ELSE
        RETURN False

```

## Notes
- **Stake Calculation**: The required stake for proposing or voting on a block should be dynamically adjusted based on network parameters (e.g., total stake, block height).  
- **Performance**: Validation must be efficient to handle high transaction volumes; consider caching frequently accessed data like validator stakes.  
- **Security**: Use robust cryptographic primitives to prevent signature forgery and ensure transaction authenticity.  
- **Edge Cases**: Handle scenarios like zero-stake validators, invalid transaction formats, or insufficient balances gracefully.  
- **TODO**: Implement slashing logic to penalize validators who propose invalid blocks or transactions.
