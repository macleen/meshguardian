# Trust Graphs Module

## Purpose
The Trust Graphs module is responsible for managing and analyzing trust relationships between nodes in a network. It exists to enable secure and reliable communication by leveraging trust metrics to assess the credibility of nodes, particularly in decentralized or peer-to-peer systems. This module is critical for applications where trust-based decisions are necessary, such as routing in crisis response networks or secure data sharing in IoT ecosystems.

## Interfaces
- **build_trust_graph(nodes, relationships)**: Constructs a trust graph from a set of nodes and their trust relationships.  
- **calculate_trust_score(node, target)**: Computes the trust score from a given node to a target node based on the trust graph.  
- **update_trust_relationship(source, target, trust_value)**: Updates or adds a trust relationship between two nodes with a specified trust value.  
- **get_trusted_neighbors(node)**: Retrieves a list of nodes that are directly trusted by a given node.  

## Depends On
- **/pseudo-code/data/graph.md**: Provides graph data structures and algorithms for managing nodes and edges.  
- **/pseudo-code/crypto/identity.md**: Supplies cryptographic identities and verification for nodes.  
- **/pseudo-code/exceptions/trust_errors.md**: Defines custom exceptions for trust-related errors.  

## Called By
- **/pseudo-code/routing/trust_based_routing.md**: Uses trust scores to make routing decisions in trust-sensitive networks.  
- **/pseudo-code/security/access_control.md**: Leverages trust relationships to enforce access policies in distributed systems.  

## Used In
- **Use Case 5.15: Aid Relays**: Utilizes trust graphs to ensure secure and reliable routing of supply tracking data in crisis zones.  
- **Use Case 5.16: Emergency Chat**: Employs trust relationships to verify the authenticity of messages in real-time communication systems.  

## Pseudocode
```pseudo-code
// Function to build a trust graph from nodes and relationships
FUNCTION build_trust_graph(nodes, relationships)
    graph = NEW Graph()
    FOR each node IN nodes
        ADD_NODE(graph, node)
    FOR each relationship IN relationships
        ADD_EDGE(graph, relationship.source, relationship.target, relationship.trust_value)
    RETURN graph

// Function to calculate trust score from node to target
FUNCTION calculate_trust_score(node, target)
    IF node == target
        RETURN 1.0  // Full trust in self
    path = FIND_SHORTEST_PATH(graph, node, target)
    IF path IS NULL
        RETURN 0.0  // No trust path exists
    trust_score = 1.0
    FOR each edge IN path
        trust_score = trust_score * edge.trust_value
    RETURN trust_score

// Function to update or add a trust relationship
FUNCTION update_trust_relationship(source, target, trust_value)
    IF trust_value < 0 OR trust_value > 1
        RAISE InvalidTrustValueError("Trust value must be between 0 and 1")
    IF NOT NODE_EXISTS(graph, source) OR NOT NODE_EXISTS(graph, target)
        RAISE NodeNotFoundError("Source or target node not found in graph")
    SET_EDGE(graph, source, target, trust_value)

// Function to get trusted neighbors of a node
FUNCTION get_trusted_neighbors(node)
    neighbors = GET_NEIGHBORS(graph, node)
    trusted_neighbors = []
    FOR each neighbor IN neighbors
        IF GET_EDGE_VALUE(graph, node, neighbor) > TRUST_THRESHOLD
            APPEND trusted_neighbors, neighbor
    RETURN trusted_neighbors

```

## Notes
- **Trust Calculation**: The trust score is computed multiplicatively along the shortest path, assuming trust values are between 0 and 1. Alternative methods (e.g., additive trust) could be explored for different trust models.  
- **Performance**: For large graphs, optimize pathfinding (e.g., using Dijkstra's algorithm with priority queues) to ensure efficiency.  
- **Security**: Trust values should be validated to prevent manipulation; consider cryptographic signatures for trust updates.  
- **Edge Cases**: Handle scenarios like isolated nodes, cycles in the graph, or negative trust values (though currently clamped to 0-1).  
- **TODO**: Implement trust decay over time to account for aging relationships.
