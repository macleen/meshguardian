# Glossary Module

## Purpose
The Glossary module provides a centralized repository of terms, definitions, and acronyms used throughout the system. It ensures consistent understanding and usage of terminology across documentation, code, and communication, crucial for maintaining clarity in complex systems, with robust error handling and logging for traceability. The module includes terms related to adaptive compression and time-delayed consensus to support enhanced data efficiency and interplanetary communication features.

## Interfaces
- **get_definition(term)**: Retrieve the definition of a specified term from the glossary.
- **add_term(term, definition)**: Add a new term and its definition to the glossary.
- **update_term(term, new_definition)**: Update the definition of an existing term.
- **list_terms()**: Return a list of all terms currently in the glossary.

## Depends On
- **/pseudo-code/shared/helpers.md**: Provides string manipulation and utility functions for term processing.
- **/pseudo-code/logging/logger.md**: Logs errors and events for traceability.

## Called By
- **/pseudo-code/documentation/generator.md**: Uses this module to generate documentation with consistent terminology.
- **/pseudo-code/ui/help_system.md**: Integrates glossary definitions into the help system for user assistance.

## Used In
- **Use Case 5.15: Aid Relays**: Ensures consistent terminology in supply tracking documentation, including compression-related terms.
- **Use Case 5.16: Emergency Chat**: Provides definitions for terms used in real-time communication interfaces, such as adaptive compression.
- **Use Case 5.1.1: Mars Rover Data Relay**: Uses terms like Asynchronous Delay-Tolerant Consensus for interplanetary communication documentation.

## Pseudocode
```pseudocode
// Initialize the glossary as a persistent dictionary
PERSISTENT glossary = {
    "Adaptive Compression Selection": "A mechanism to dynamically choose a compression algorithm (e.g., lz4, zstd, TinyML) based on packet size, signal strength, and battery health to optimize bandwidth and energy efficiency.",
    "Compression Type": "A code indicating the compression algorithm used for a packet payload (e.g., 0x0004 for lz4, 0x0002 for zstd, 0x0006 for TinyML, 0x0000 for no compression).",
    "TinyML": "A lightweight machine learning framework used for context-aware compression, optimizing packet payloads based on content patterns in resource-constrained environments.",
    "Asynchronous Delay-Tolerant Consensus": "A consensus mechanism for extreme-delay environments (e.g., 15-30 minute RTTs) that allows asynchronous validation using logical clocks and extended timeout windows, used in the Interplanetary Profile.",
    "Logical Clock": "A mechanism (e.g., Lamport timestamp, vector clock) for ordering events in distributed systems without synchronized real-time clocks, critical for interplanetary consensus.",
    "Time-Delayed Consensus": "A consensus model that extends validation phases to accommodate high-latency environments, ensuring reliability in interplanetary networks."

## Notes
- Case Sensitivity: Term lookups are case-insensitive using helpers.to_lower_case for flexibility.
- Performance: In-memory storage ensures fast lookups; future persistence requires a storage module.
- Security: Input validation prevents null or empty terms/definitions, with logging to detect misuse.
- Error Handling: Errors are logged as Tier 1 events (Bit 15) via logger.md, ensuring traceability in crisis scenarios.
- New Terms: Added Asynchronous Delay-Tolerant Consensus, Logical Clock, and Time-Delayed Consensus to support the Interplanetary Profileâ€™s consensus model, ensuring clarity in documentation and user interfaces.
- Edge Cases: Handles missing terms, duplicates, and invalid inputs with specific errors (ValidationError, TermNotFoundError, TermAlreadyExistsError).

## TODO
- Implement functionality to categorize terms by domain or context (e.g., compression, consensus, networking).
- Add persistent storage once /pseudo-code/storage/data_store.md is available.
- Expand glossary with additional interplanetary terms (e.g., RTT, orbital window) as needed.
