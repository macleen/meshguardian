# Secure Credential Storage Module

## Purpose
The Secure Credential Storage module handles the secure storage of sensitive credentials, such as passwords, API keys, or cryptographic keys. It exists to provide a centralized, secure way to manage these credentials across the system, ensuring they are protected from unauthorized access and tampering. This module is critical for maintaining the confidentiality and integrity of sensitive data in applications like secure messaging, data storage, or communication in untrusted environments.

## Interfaces
- **Function: `store_credential(credential_id, credential)`**  
  Securely stores a credential with a unique identifier.  
- **Function: `retrieve_credential(credential_id)`**  
  Retrieves a stored credential by its identifier.  
- **Function: `delete_credential(credential_id)`**  
  Removes a stored credential from the secure storage.  

## Depends On
- **/pseudo-code/crypto/encryption.md**: Provides encryption and decryption functions to secure credentials.  
- **/pseudo-code/storage/secure_vault.md**: Manages the secure storage of encrypted credentials.  
- **/pseudo-code/exceptions/security_errors.md**: Defines custom exceptions for security-related errors.  

## Called By
- **/pseudo-code/security/auth.md**: Uses this module to store and retrieve user credentials securely.  
- **/pseudo-code/security/key_management.md**: Leverages this module for managing cryptographic keys.  

## Used In
- **Use Case 5.15: Aid Relays**: Ensures that credentials for accessing external logistics systems are stored securely.  
- **Use Case 5.16: Emergency Chat**: Protects credentials used for encrypting real-time communications.  

## Pseudocode
The following pseudo-code outlines the core logic for securely storing, retrieving, and deleting credentials.
```pseudocode
/* Function: store_credential */
FUNCTION store_credential(credential_id, credential)
    IF NOT VALIDATE_CREDENTIAL(credential)
        RAISE InvalidCredentialError("Invalid credential format")
    END IF
    TRY
        encrypted_credential = ENCRYPT(credential)
        STORE_IN_VAULT(credential_id, encrypted_credential)
        LOG("Credential stored securely with ID: " + credential_id)
    FINALLY
        SECURE_WIPE(credential)  // Clear plaintext from memory
    END TRY

/* Function: retrieve_credential */
FUNCTION retrieve_credential(credential_id)
    IF NOT HAS_ACCESS_PERMISSION(credential_id)
        RAISE AccessDeniedError("Unauthorized access to credential")
    END IF
    INCREMENT_ACCESS_COUNTER(credential_id)
    IF GET_ACCESS_COUNT(credential_id) > DAILY_LIMIT
        RAISE CredentialOveruseError("Credential access limit exceeded")
    END IF
    encrypted_credential = RETRIEVE_FROM_VAULT(credential_id)
    IF encrypted_credential IS NULL
        RAISE CredentialNotFoundError("No credential found for ID: " + credential_id)
    END IF
    credential = DECRYPT(encrypted_credential)
    LOG("Credential retrieved for ID: " + credential_id)
    RETURN credential

/* Function: delete_credential */
FUNCTION delete_credential(credential_id)
    OVERWRITE_BEFORE_DELETE(credential_id)
    REMOVE_FROM_VAULT(credential_id)
    LOG("Credential deleted for ID: " + credential_id)

/* Function: rotate_credential */
FUNCTION rotate_credential(credential_id, new_credential)
    IF NOT VALIDATE_CREDENTIAL(new_credential)
        RAISE InvalidCredentialError("Invalid new credential format")
    END IF
    old_credential = CALL retrieve_credential(credential_id)
    CALL store_credential(credential_id, new_credential)
    CALL delete_credential(credential_id + ".old")
    LOG("Credential rotated for ID: " + credential_id)
```

## Notes
- **Key Management**: Encryption keys should be managed securely, ideally using a hardware security module (HSM).
- **Access Control**: Role-based access controls are enforced for credential retrieval.
- **Performance**: Balance security with performance; consider caching for frequently used credentials.
- **Edge Cases**: Handle missing credentials or decryption failures gracefully. 
- **Rotation Procedures**: Use rotate_credential to periodically refresh credentials.
- **Compliance**: Aligns with NIST SP 800-63B, PCI DSS 3.2.1, and GDPR Art. 32 for secure credential storage.
- **TODO**: Implement zero-knowledge proofs for credential verification and quantum-resistant encryption.
