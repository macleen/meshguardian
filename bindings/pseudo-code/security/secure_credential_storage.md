# Secure Credential Storage Module

## Purpose
The Secure Credential Storage module handles the secure storage of sensitive credentials, such as passwords, API keys, or cryptographic keys. It exists to provide a centralized, secure way to manage these credentials across the system, ensuring they are protected from unauthorized access and tampering. This module is critical for maintaining the confidentiality and integrity of sensitive data in applications like secure messaging, data storage, or communication in untrusted environments.

## Interfaces
- **Function: `store_credential(credential_id, credential)`**  
  Securely stores a credential with a unique identifier.  
- **Function: `retrieve_credential(credential_id)`**  
  Retrieves a stored credential by its identifier.  
- **Function: `delete_credential(credential_id)`**  
  Removes a stored credential from the secure storage.  

## Depends On
- **/pseudo-code/crypto/encryption.md**: Provides encryption and decryption functions to secure credentials.  
- **/pseudo-code/storage/secure_vault.md**: Manages the secure storage of encrypted credentials.  
- **/pseudo-code/exceptions/security_errors.md**: Defines custom exceptions for security-related errors.  

## Called By
- **/pseudo-code/security/auth.md**: Uses this module to store and retrieve user credentials securely.  
- **/pseudo-code/security/key_management.md**: Leverages this module for managing cryptographic keys.  

## Used In
- **Use Case 5.15: Aid Relays**: Ensures that credentials for accessing external logistics systems are stored securely.  
- **Use Case 5.16: Emergency Chat**: Protects credentials used for encrypting real-time communications.  

## Pseudocode
The following pseudo-code outlines the core logic for securely storing, retrieving, and deleting credentials.
```pseudocode
// Function: store_credential
FUNCTION store_credential(credential_id, credential)
    // Encrypt the credential using a secure encryption algorithm
    encrypted_credential = ENCRYPT(credential)
    // Store the encrypted credential in the secure vault
    STORE_IN_VAULT(credential_id, encrypted_credential)
    // Log the storage event
    LOG("Credential stored securely with ID: " + credential_id)

// Function: retrieve_credential
FUNCTION retrieve_credential(credential_id)
    // Retrieve the encrypted credential from the secure vault
    encrypted_credential = RETRIEVE_FROM_VAULT(credential_id)
    IF encrypted_credential IS NULL THEN
        RAISE CredentialNotFoundError("No credential found for ID: " + credential_id)
    END IF
    // Decrypt the credential
    credential = DECRYPT(encrypted_credential)
    // Log the retrieval event
    LOG("Credential retrieved for ID: " + credential_id)
    RETURN credential

// Function: delete_credential
FUNCTION delete_credential(credential_id)
    // Remove the credential from the secure vault
    REMOVE_FROM_VAULT(credential_id)
    // Log the deletion event
    LOG("Credential deleted for ID: " + credential_id)
```

## Notes
- **Key Management**: Ensure that encryption keys are managed securely, possibly using a hardware security module (HSM).  
- **Access Control**: Implement strict access controls to prevent unauthorized retrieval of credentials.  
- **Performance**: Balance security with performance, as encryption and decryption can introduce latency.  
- **Edge Cases**: Handle scenarios where credentials are not found or decryption fails gracefully.  
- **TODO**: Add support for credential rotation and expiration to enhance security.
