# Encryption Module

## Purpose
The Encryption module is designed to secure data by providing encryption and decryption capabilities. It exists to protect sensitive information from unauthorized access, tampering, or interception, ensuring confidentiality, integrity, and authenticity. This is essential for applications like secure messaging, data storage, or communication in untrusted environments.

## Interfaces
The module exposes the following key functions for encryption and related operations:
- **`encrypt_data(data, key)`**: Encrypts the input data using the provided key.
- **`decrypt_data(encrypted_data, key)`**: Decrypts encrypted data using the specified key.
- **`generate_key()`**: Creates a new encryption key.
- **`load_key(key_name)`**: Retrieves an existing key by its name or identifier.

## Depends On
This module relies on the following components:
- **`/pseudo-code/security/key_management.md`**: Handles the generation, storage, and retrieval of encryption keys.
- **`/pseudo-code/shared/crypto_library.md`**: Supplies cryptographic algorithms and utilities for encryption and decryption.

## Called By
The Encryption module is used by:
- **`/pseudo-code/networking/data_transfer.md`**: Secures data before it is transmitted over the network.
- **`/pseudo-code/storage/data_storage.md`**: Encrypts data prior to storage to safeguard it from unauthorized access.

## Used In
This module is referenced in the following use cases:
- **Use Case 5.15**: Secure communication in crisis zones, protecting data during multi-hop transfers.
- **Use Case 5.16**: Safeguarding sensitive configuration files from unauthorized access or modification.

## Pseudocode
The core logic of the module is outlined below in pseudocode:

```pseudocode
FUNCTION encrypt_data(data, key)
    // Encrypts data with the provided key
    IF key IS NULL OR key IS INVALID
        RAISE InvalidKeyError("Encryption key is invalid or missing")
    encrypted_data = CALL crypto_library.encrypt(data, key)
    RETURN encrypted_data

FUNCTION decrypt_data(encrypted_data, key)
    // Decrypts data with the provided key
    IF key IS NULL OR key IS INVALID
        RAISE InvalidKeyError("Decryption key is invalid or missing")
    decrypted_data = CALL crypto_library.decrypt(encrypted_data, key)
    RETURN decrypted_data

FUNCTION generate_key()
    // Generates a new encryption key
    new_key = CALL key_management.generate_key()
    RETURN new_key

FUNCTION load_key(key_name)
    // Loads an existing key by name
    IF key_name NOT IN key_management.keys
        RAISE KeyNotFoundError("Key '" + key_name + "' not found")
    key = CALL key_management.load_key(key_name)
    RETURN key
```

## Notes
- **Key Security**: Encryption keys should be stored securely, such as in a key vault or hardware security module (HSM), to prevent unauthorized access or leakage.
- **Performance Considerations**: Encryption and decryption operations may introduce latency; consider optimizations for time-sensitive applications.
- **Algorithm Support**: The module currently relies on a single encryption algorithm; future enhancements could include support for multiple algorithms (e.g., AES, RSA).
- **Error Handling**: The pseudocode includes checks for invalid or missing keys, improving robustness and debugging.
- **Future Improvements**: Plan to implement key rotation to periodically refresh encryption keys, enhancing long-term security.
