# Risk Assessment Module

## Purpose
The Risk Assessment module dynamically evaluates security risks within the MeshGuardian system by analyzing patterns, anomalies, and contextual factors. It exists to enhance adaptive security measures, such as rate limiting or access control, by providing real-time risk scores to guide decision-making. This module is critical for maintaining system integrity in decentralized, real-world environments like crisis zones.

## Interfaces
- **Function: `assess_risk(source, behavior_data)`**  
  Calculates a risk score based on the sourceâ€™s behavior and contextual data.  
- **Function: `update_risk_profile(source, new_data)`**  
  Updates the risk profile for a given source with new behavioral data.  
- **Function: `get_risk_thresholds()`**  
  Retrieves predefined risk thresholds for decision-making.  

## Depends On
- **/pseudo-code/storage/risk_profile_storage.md**: Manages storage and retrieval of risk profiles.  
- **/pseudo-code/shared/helpers.md**: Provides utility functions for data parsing and validation.  
- **/pseudo-code/exceptions/security_errors.md**: Defines custom exceptions for risk assessment errors.  

## Called By
- **/pseudo-code/security/rate_limiting.md**: Uses risk scores to adjust rate limits dynamically.  
- **/pseudo-code/security/auth.md**: Incorporates risk assessments into authentication decisions.  

## Used In
- **Use Case 5.15: Aid Relays**: Assesses risks for authentication attempts in crisis zones to prevent unauthorized access.  
- **Use Case 5.16: Emergency Chat**: Evaluates message patterns to detect potential threats in real-time communication.  

## Pseudocode
The following pseudo-code outlines the core logic for assessing and managing security risks.
```pseudocode
// Function: assess_risk
FUNCTION assess_risk(source, behavior_data)
    risk_profile = RETRIEVE_RISK_PROFILE(source)
    risk_score = CALCULATE_RISK_SCORE(risk_profile, behavior_data)
    IF risk_score > get_risk_thresholds().high THEN
        FLAG_AS_HIGH_RISK(source)
        LOG("High risk detected for " + source)
    END IF
    RETURN risk_score

// Function: update_risk_profile
FUNCTION update_risk_profile(source, new_data)
    risk_profile = RETRIEVE_RISK_PROFILE(source)
    UPDATE_RISK_PROFILE(risk_profile, new_data)
    STORE_RISK_PROFILE(source, risk_profile)
    LOG("Risk profile updated for " + source)

// Function: get_risk_thresholds
FUNCTION get_risk_thresholds()
    thresholds = LOAD_THRESHOLDS_FROM_CONFIG()
    RETURN thresholds
```

## Notes
- **Dynamic Assessment**: Risk scores should adapt to real-time data, such as login frequency or geographic anomalies.  
- **Scalability**: Optimize storage and computation for large numbers of sources in a mesh network.  
- **Security**: Protect risk profiles from tampering with encryption or access controls.  
- **TODO**: Integrate machine learning models for predictive risk analysis.  
- **TODO**: Add support for multi-factor risk indicators (e.g., IP, device fingerprint).
