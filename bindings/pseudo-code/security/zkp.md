# ZKP Module

## Purpose
The ZKP module provides a framework for implementing Zero-Knowledge Proofs (ZKPs) in the system. It exists to enable secure verification of claims without exposing sensitive data, which is crucial for applications requiring privacy and security, such as identity verification, secure voting, or confidential transactions. This module allows one party to prove to another that a statement is true without revealing any additional information beyond the validity of the statement itself.

## Interfaces
- **setup_zkp(parameters)**: Initializes the ZKP system with necessary parameters, generating public parameters or keys.  
- **generate_proof(statement, witness)**: Creates a proof for a given statement using a witness, leveraging the ZKP protocol.  
- **verify_proof(proof, statement)**: Verifies the validity of a proof for a given statement using the ZKP protocol.  

## Depends On
- **/pseudo-code/crypto/zkp_library.md**: Provides core ZKP functions such as `GENERATE_PUBLIC_PARAMS`, `CREATE_PROOF`, and `VERIFY_PROOF`.  
- **/pseudo-code/crypto/hashes.md**: Supplies hash functions used within ZKP operations.  
- **/pseudo-code/crypto/elliptic_curves.md**: Offers elliptic curve operations if the chosen ZKP scheme requires them.  

## Called By
- **/pseudo-code/security/auth.md**: Uses `generate_proof` to create authentication proofs and `verify_proof` to validate them.  
- **/pseudo-code/blockchain/transactions.md**: Employs `generate_proof` for transaction validation and `verify_proof` to confirm transaction proofs.  

## Used In
- **Use Case 5.15: Secure Voting**: Voters prove eligibility without revealing their identity, ensuring privacy in the voting process.  
- **Use Case 5.16: Confidential Transactions**: Users prove transaction validity without disclosing amounts or parties involved, maintaining financial privacy.  


## Pseudocode
The detailed logic for the ZKP module is provided below in pseudo-code format, outlining the core operations of setup, proof generation, and proof verification.
```pseudocode
// Function to set up the ZKP system with necessary parameters
FUNCTION setup_zkp(parameters)
    IF NOT VALIDATE_ZKP_PARAMS(parameters)
        RAISE InvalidParametersError("Invalid ZKP parameters")
    END IF
    public_params = ZKP_LIBRARY.GENERATE_PUBLIC_PARAMS(parameters)
    LOG_TRUSTED_SETUP_PARTICIPANTS()
    RETURN public_params

// Function to generate a proof for a given statement using a witness
FUNCTION generate_proof(statement, witness)
    nonce = GENERATE_NONCE()
    proof = ZKP_LIBRARY.CREATE_PROOF(statement, witness, nonce)
    RETURN proof

// Function to verify a proof for a given statement
FUNCTION verify_proof(proof, statement)
    IF proof.timestamp < CURRENT_TIME - PROOF_LIFETIME
        RETURN False
    END IF
    is_valid = ZKP_LIBRARY.VERIFY_PROOF(proof, statement)
    RETURN is_valid

```

## Notes
- **Scheme Selection**: Different ZKP schemes (e.g., zk-SNARKs, zk-STARKs, Bulletproofs) offer varying trade-offs in terms of security, efficiency, and proof size. Choose based on the specific requirements of the use case.  
- **Performance**: Generating and verifying proofs can be computationally intensive. Optimize where possible, and consider hardware acceleration for production systems.
- **Security**:  Ensure the chosen ZKP scheme is resistant to known attacks and that parameters are set appropriately. Keep the witness secret to prevent security breaches.
- **Edge Cases**: Handle scenarios where proofs are invalid or where the witness is incorrect. Implement robust error handling to manage these cases gracefully.
- **TODO**: Implement specific ZKP schemes like zk-SNARKs or Bulletproofs for targeted applications.
- Integrate with existing cryptographic libraries for security auditing.
- Add side-channel attack protections (e.g., timing attack resistance).
- Implement detailed audit logging for production use.
