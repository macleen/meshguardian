# External Sync Module

## Purpose
The External Sync module manages the synchronization of data between the internal system and external services, such as third-party APIs, databases, or other systems. It exists to ensure seamless integration and data consistency, which is critical for real-time applications like emergency response coordination, IoT device management, or crisis management tools. By keeping internal and external data aligned, this module supports operational reliability and accuracy in distributed environments.

## Interfaces
The module exposes the following key functions to facilitate synchronization and related operations:
- **sync_data(external_service, data)**: Initiates synchronization of the provided data with the specified external service.
- **schedule_sync(service, interval)**: Sets up periodic synchronization with an external service at a specified interval (e.g., every 5 minutes).
- **handle_sync_error(error, service)**: Manages errors that occur during synchronization attempts, ensuring proper logging and notifications.
- **get_sync_status(service)**: Retrieves the current synchronization status for a given external service (e.g., "synced," "failed").

## Depends On
This module relies on the following dependencies within the system:
- **/pseudo-code/data/internal_database.md**: Provides access to internal data for synchronization and updates the internal state after successful syncs.
- **/pseudo-code/exceptions/sync_errors.md**: Defines custom exceptions for synchronization-related errors.
- **/pseudo-code/scheduling/task_scheduler.md**: Handles the scheduling of periodic synchronization tasks.

## Called By
The External Sync module is invoked by higher-level components that orchestrate or automate synchronization processes:
- **/pseudo-code/application_layer/sync_manager.md**: Coordinates synchronization across multiple external services as part of the application logic.
- **/pseudo-code/automation/sync_automator.md**: Automates synchronization tasks based on predefined rules or triggers.

## Used In
The module supports specific use cases where data synchronization is essential:
- **Use Case 5.15: Aid Relays** – Synchronizes supply tracking data with external logistics systems to ensure accurate resource allocation during crisis response.
- **Use Case 5.16: Emergency Chat** – Maintains real-time messaging data consistency across distributed nodes for effective communication in emergencies.


## Pseudocode
```pseudocode
FUNCTION sync_data(external_service, data)
    TRY
        // Prepare data for synchronization
        sync_payload = PREPARE_SYNC_DATA(data)
        // Send data to the external service
        response = CALL external_service.sync(sync_payload)
        IF response.status == "success"
            // Update internal sync status
            UPDATE_INTERNAL_SYNC_STATUS(external_service, "synced")
        ELSE
            RAISE SyncError("Synchronization failed: " + response.error)
    CATCH SyncError AS error
        CALL handle_sync_error(error, external_service)

FUNCTION schedule_sync(service, interval)
    // Schedule periodic synchronization
    TASK = CREATE_SYNC_TASK(service)
    SCHEDULE_TASK(TASK, interval)

FUNCTION handle_sync_error(error, service)
    // Log the error and notify administrators
    LOG_ERROR("Sync error for " + service + ": " + error.message)
    NOTIFY_ADMINS("Synchronization failed for " + service)

FUNCTION get_sync_status(service)
    // Retrieve the current sync status
    status = RETRIEVE_SYNC_STATUS(service)
    RETURN status
```

## Notes
Additional considerations for implementing this module include:
- **Error Handling**: Implement retry mechanisms for transient sync failures (e.g., network timeouts) to improve reliability.
- **Performance**: Use data batching to reduce the number of API calls when synchronizing large datasets.
- **Security**: Encrypt sensitive data before transmission to external services to protect confidentiality.
- **Scalability**: Optimize synchronization for large-scale data by supporting incremental syncs (only syncing changes since the last update).
- **TODO**: Add support for two-way synchronization to allow external services to update the internal system as well.
