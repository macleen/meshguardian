# Hardware Interface Module

## Purpose
The Hardware Interface module provides a standardized abstraction layer for interacting with hardware components involved in the protocol process. It exists to bridge the gap between high-level protocol logic (e.g., packet transmission) and low-level hardware operations (e.g., signal conversion), ensuring seamless integration of devices like transceivers, sensors, and network interfaces. This module is critical for MeshGuardian’s ability to operate across diverse hardware platforms in challenging environments.

## Interfaces
- **Function: `init_hardware(device_id)`**  
  Initializes the hardware device with necessary configurations for protocol operations.  
- **Function: `send_packet(device_id, packet)`**  
  Transmits a packet through the specified device’s hardware interface.  
- **Function: `receive_packet(device_id)`**  
  Receives a packet from the specified device’s hardware interface.  
- **Function: `get_hardware_status(device_id)`**  
  Retrieves the current operational status of the hardware device.  

## Depends On
- **/pseudo-code/device/hardware_config.md**: Uses `apply_config` to configure hardware devices during initialization.  
- **/pseudo-code/device/drivers.md**: Provides low-level drivers for interacting with hardware components like transceivers and NICs.  
- **/pseudo-code/exceptions/hardware_errors.md**: Defines custom exceptions for hardware-related issues (e.g., `DeviceNotFoundError`, `TransmissionError`).  

## Called By
- **/pseudo-code/networking/packet_sending.md**: Invokes `send_packet` to transmit packets via hardware.  
- **/pseudo-code/networking/packet_receiving.md**: Uses `receive_packet` to capture incoming packets from hardware.  
- **/pseudo-code/monitoring/node_monitor.md**: Calls `get_hardware_status` to monitor device health during node checks.  

## Used In
- **Use Case 5.15: Aid Relays**: Interfaces with hardware to transmit supply tracking data in crisis zones with limited connectivity.  
- **Use Case 5.16: Emergency Chat**: Manages hardware interactions for real-time message transmission in disaster scenarios.  

## Pseudocode
```pseudo-code
The following pseudo-code outlines the core logic for interfacing with hardware components in the protocol process.

FUNCTION init_hardware(device_id)
    IF NOT device_exists(device_id)
        RAISE DeviceNotFoundError("Device " + device_id + " not found")
    CALL hardware_config.apply_config(device_id)
    driver = LOAD_DRIVER(device_id)
    INITIALIZE_DRIVER(driver)
    RETURN success_status

FUNCTION send_packet(device_id, packet)
    IF NOT is_device_ready(device_id)
        RAISE DeviceNotReadyError("Device " + device_id + " is not ready")
    // Select protocol based on capability flags
    IF packet.headers.capability_flags BIT 13
        protocol = CALL select_protocol_ml(packet.network_metrics)
    ELSE
        protocol = CALL select_protocol_static(packet.network_metrics)
    END IF
    driver = LOAD_DRIVER(device_id, protocol)
    signal = CONVERT_TO_SIGNAL(packet)
    TRANSMIT_SIGNAL(driver, signal)
    IF NOT transmission_successful()
        RAISE TransmissionError("Failed to send packet via device " + device_id)
    RETURN success_status

FUNCTION receive_packet(device_id)
    IF NOT is_device_ready(device_id)
        RAISE DeviceNotReadyError("Device " + device_id + " is not ready")
    driver = LOAD_DRIVER(device_id)
    signal = RECEIVE_SIGNAL(driver)
    packet = CONVERT_FROM_SIGNAL(signal)
    IF NOT is_valid_packet(packet)
        RAISE PacketCorruptionError("Received packet is corrupted")
    RETURN packet

FUNCTION get_hardware_status(device_id)
    driver = LOAD_DRIVER(device_id)
    status = CHECK_HARDWARE_STATUS(driver)
    RETURN status
```

## Notes
- **Hardware Variability**: Different devices may require specific drivers; ensure `LOAD_DRIVER` supports a variety of hardware types.  
- **Error Handling**: Robustly handle hardware failures (e.g., signal loss, device offline) with appropriate retries or failover mechanisms.  
- **Performance**: Minimize latency in `send_packet` and `receive_packet` to support real-time communication needs.  
- **Security**: Ensure signals are encrypted before transmission to prevent interception, especially in crisis environments.  
- **TODO**: Add support for hardware interrupts to handle asynchronous events like incoming packets.
