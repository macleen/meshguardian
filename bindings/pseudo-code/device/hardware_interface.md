# Hardware Interface Module

## Purpose
The Hardware Interface module provides a standardized abstraction layer for interacting with hardware components involved in the protocol process. It bridges high-level protocol logic (e.g., packet transmission) and low-level hardware operations (e.g., signal conversion), ensuring seamless integration of devices like transceivers, sensors, and network interfaces. This module is critical for MeshGuardian’s ability to operate across diverse hardware platforms in challenging environments, including crisis zones and interplanetary scenarios.

## Interfaces
- **Function: `init_hardware(device_id)`**  
  Initializes the hardware device with necessary configurations for protocol operations.  
- **Function: `send_packet(device_id, packet)`**  
  Transmits a packet through the specified device’s hardware interface.  
- **Function: `receive_packet(device_id)`**  
  Receives a packet from the specified device’s hardware interface.  
- **Function: `get_hardware_status(device_id)`**  
  Retrieves the current operational status of the hardware device.  

## Depends On
- **/pseudo-code/device/hardware_config.md**: Uses `apply_config` to configure hardware devices during initialization.  
- **/pseudo-code/device/drivers.md**: Provides low-level drivers for interacting with hardware components like transceivers and NICs.  
- **/pseudo-code/exceptions/hardware_errors.md**: Defines custom exceptions for hardware-related issues (e.g., `DeviceNotFoundError`, `TransmissionError`).  

## Called By
- **/pseudo-code/networking/packet_sending.md**: Invokes `send_packet` to transmit packets via hardware.  
- **/pseudo-code/networking/packet_receiving.md**: Uses `receive_packet` to capture incoming packets from hardware.  
- **/pseudo-code/monitoring/node_monitor.md**: Calls `get_hardware_status` to monitor device health during node checks.  

## Used In
- **Use Case 5.15: Aid Relays**: Interfaces with hardware to transmit supply tracking data in crisis zones with limited connectivity.  
- **Use Case 5.16: Emergency Chat**: Manages hardware interactions for real-time message transmission in disaster scenarios.  
- **Use Case 5.17: Smart City Emergency Response**: Ensures secure, real-time data validation with quantum-ready signatures.

## Pseudocode
```pseudo-code
FUNCTION init_hardware(device_id)
    IF NOT device_exists(device_id)
        CALL log_message("ERROR", "Device " + device_id + " not found")
        RAISE DeviceNotFoundError("Device " + device_id + " not found")
    CALL hardware_config.apply_config(device_id)
    driver = LOAD_DRIVER(device_id)
    INITIALIZE_DRIVER(driver)
    RETURN success_status

FUNCTION send_packet(device_id, packet)
    IF NOT is_device_ready(device_id)
        CALL log_message("ERROR", "Device " + device_id + " is not ready")
        RAISE DeviceNotReadyError("Device " + device_id + " is not ready")
    // Select protocol based on 64-bit capability flags (Bit 22 for ML-based protocol selection)
    IF packet.headers.capability_flags & BIT(22)
        protocol = CALL select_protocol_ml(packet.network_metrics)
    ELSE
        protocol = CALL select_protocol_static(packet.network_metrics)
    END IF
    driver = LOAD_DRIVER(device_id, protocol)
    signal = CONVERT_TO_SIGNAL(packet)
    TRANSMIT_SIGNAL(driver, signal)
    IF NOT transmission_successful()
        CALL log_message("ERROR", "Failed to send packet via device " + device_id)
        RAISE TransmissionError("Failed to send packet via device " + device_id)
    RETURN success_status

FUNCTION receive_packet(device_id)
    IF NOT is_device_ready(device_id)
        CALL log_message("ERROR", "Device " + device_id + " is not ready")
        RAISE DeviceNotReadyError("Device " + device_id + " is not ready")
    driver = LOAD_DRIVER(device_id)
    signal = RECEIVE_SIGNAL(driver)
    packet = CONVERT_FROM_SIGNAL(signal)
    IF NOT is_valid_packet(packet)
        CALL log_message("ERROR", "Received packet is corrupted from device " + device_id)
        RAISE PacketCorruptionError("Received packet is corrupted")
    RETURN packet

FUNCTION get_hardware_status(device_id)
    driver = LOAD_DRIVER(device_id)
    status = CHECK_HARDWARE_STATUS(driver)
    RETURN status
```

## Notes
- Capability Flags: Updated to support 64-bit capability flags. In send_packet, protocol selection now uses Bit 22 for ML-based protocol choice (previously Bit 13 in the 32-bit system). Other features like extended compression (Bit 24) and interplanetary mode (Bit 40) are handled via hardware_config.apply_config.  
- Error Logging: Added logging for critical hardware errors (e.g., device not found, not ready, transmission failures) using log_message to improve traceability, especially for debugging in crisis or interplanetary scenarios.  
- Performance: Ensure that logging does not introduce significant delays; consider asynchronous logging if necessary to maintain real-time performance.  
- Security: Ensure sensitive configuration data is handled securely during apply_config, and assume packet-level encryption (e.g., quantum-ready signatures) is managed at a higher level.  
- Hardware Variability: Different devices may require specific drivers; LOAD_DRIVER must support diverse hardware types and configurations based on capability flags. 

## TODO
- Add support for hardware interrupts to handle asynchronous events like incoming packets.  
- Ensure hardware drivers support new features such as extended compression (Bit 24) and interplanetary mode (Bit 40) when enabled via capability flags.  
- Optimize for low-power devices (e.g., when Bit 23 for Low-Energy Mode is set) by minimizing energy consumption in hardware operations.
