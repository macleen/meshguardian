# Hardware Interface Module

## Purpose
The Hardware Interface module provides a standardized abstraction layer for interacting with hardware components involved in the protocol process. It exists to bridge the gap between high-level protocol logic (e.g., packet transmission) and low-level hardware operations (e.g., signal conversion), ensuring seamless integration of devices like transceivers, sensors, and network interfaces. This module is critical for MeshGuardian’s ability to operate across diverse hardware platforms in challenging environments.

## Interfaces
- **Function: `init_hardware(device_id)`**  
  Initializes the hardware device with necessary configurations for protocol operations.  
- **Function: `send_packet(device_id, packet)`**  
  Transmits a packet through the specified device’s hardware interface.  
- **Function: `receive_packet(device_id)`**  
  Receives a packet from the specified device’s hardware interface.  
- **Function: `get_hardware_status(device_id)`**  
  Retrieves the current operational status of the hardware device.  

## Depends On
- **/pseudo-code/device/hardware_config.md**: Uses `apply_config` to configure hardware devices during initialization.  
- **/pseudo-code/device/drivers.md**: Provides low-level drivers for interacting with hardware components like transceivers and NICs.  
- **/pseudo-code/exceptions/hardware_errors.md**: Defines custom exceptions for hardware-related issues (e.g., `DeviceNotFoundError`, `TransmissionError`).  

## Called By
- **/pseudo-code/networking/packet_sending.md**: Invokes `send_packet` to transmit packets via hardware.  
- **/pseudo-code/networking/packet_receiving.md**: Uses `receive_packet` to capture incoming packets from hardware.  
- **/pseudo-code/monitoring/node_monitor.md**: Calls `get_hardware_status` to monitor device health during node checks.  

## Used In
- **Use Case 5.15: Aid Relays**: Interfaces with hardware to transmit supply tracking data in crisis zones with limited connectivity.  
- **Use Case 5.16: Emergency Chat**: Manages hardware interactions for real-time message transmission in disaster scenarios.  

## Pseudocode
```pseudo-code
The following pseudo-code outlines the core logic for interfacing with hardware components in the protocol process.

// Function: init_hardware
FUNCTION init_hardware(device_id)
    // Verify the device exists and is accessible
    IF NOT device_exists(device_id) THEN
        RAISE DeviceNotFoundError("Device " + device_id + " not found")
    END IF
    // Load and apply hardware configuration
    CALL hardware_config.apply_config(device_id)
    // Initialize device drivers
    driver = LOAD_DRIVER(device_id)
    INITIALIZE_DRIVER(driver)
    RETURN success_status

// Function: send_packet
FUNCTION send_packet(device_id, packet)
    // Ensure device is initialized
    IF NOT is_device_ready(device_id) THEN
        RAISE DeviceNotReadyError("Device " + device_id + " is not ready")
    END IF
    // Convert packet to signal using device driver
    signal = CONVERT_TO_SIGNAL(packet)
    // Transmit the signal via hardware
    driver = LOAD_DRIVER(device_id)
    TRANSMIT_SIGNAL(driver, signal)
    // Check for transmission errors
    IF NOT transmission_successful() THEN
        RAISE TransmissionError("Failed to send packet via device " + device_id)
    END IF
    RETURN success_status

// Function: receive_packet
FUNCTION receive_packet(device_id)
    // Ensure device is initialized
    IF NOT is_device_ready(device_id) THEN
        RAISE DeviceNotReadyError("Device " + device_id + " is not ready")
    END IF
    // Receive signal from hardware
    driver = LOAD_DRIVER(device_id)
    signal = RECEIVE_SIGNAL(driver)
    // Convert signal back to packet
    packet = CONVERT_FROM_SIGNAL(signal)
    // Validate packet integrity
    IF NOT is_valid_packet(packet) THEN
        RAISE PacketCorruptionError("Received packet is corrupted")
    END IF
    RETURN packet

// Function: get_hardware_status
FUNCTION get_hardware_status(device_id)
    // Retrieve hardware status (e.g., power, connectivity, errors)
    driver = LOAD_DRIVER(device_id)
    status = CHECK_HARDWARE_STATUS(driver)
    RETURN status
```

## Notes
- **Hardware Variability**: Different devices may require specific drivers; ensure `LOAD_DRIVER` supports a variety of hardware types.  
- **Error Handling**: Robustly handle hardware failures (e.g., signal loss, device offline) with appropriate retries or failover mechanisms.  
- **Performance**: Minimize latency in `send_packet` and `receive_packet` to support real-time communication needs.  
- **Security**: Ensure signals are encrypted before transmission to prevent interception, especially in crisis environments.  
- **TODO**: Add support for hardware interrupts to handle asynchronous events like incoming packets.
