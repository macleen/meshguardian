# Hardware Integration in MeshGuardian Protocol Stack

![Hardware Integration Diagram](/docs/assets/hardware_integration_diagram.png)

## Overview

This illustration provides a visual breakdown of how **hardware components** interact with and support the protocol logic within the [MeshGuardian](https://github.com/macleen/meshguardian) architecture. While the pseudo-code directory defines software logic across modules such as networking, security, and monitoring, this diagram highlights **where and how physical hardware comes into play**‚Äîespecially in crisis, IoT, and interplanetary environments.

## Key Layers

### Hardware Layer (Bottom)
- **Transceivers, NICs, Antennas:** Enable signal-level data transmission and reception across various technologies, including LoRa, Zigbee, and interplanetary communication protocols.
- **Sensors & IoT Devices:** Source and destination nodes involved in sending or receiving data packets, with support for energy-constrained and low-power devices.
- **HSMs (Hardware Security Modules):** Used for secure key storage and cryptographic operations, including quantum-resistant algorithms when enabled.

### Device Layer
- `/device/hardware_config.md`: Applies hardware settings like transmission power, frequency band, and antenna mode. Configurations are dynamically adjusted based on 64-bit capability flags, such as enabling Low-Energy Mode (Bit 23) for power conservation or interplanetary mode (Bit 40) for high-latency communication.
- Adjusts hardware to fit mission-critical needs (e.g., conserve energy, extend range, or optimize for space missions).

### Monitoring Layer
- `/monitoring/node_monitor.md`: Continuously checks node health (CPU, battery, temperature) and adapts monitoring behavior based on the device‚Äôs power state, such as reducing monitoring frequency in Low-Energy Mode (Bit 23).
- Feeds data into protocol decisions‚Äîroutes are adjusted if a node is degraded or operating under power constraints.

### Networking Layer
- `/networking/packet_creation.md`: Generates packets with TTL, priority, and compression settings tied to hardware constraints and capability flags (e.g., extended compression via Bit 24 or FEC via Bit 25).
- `/networking/packet_sending.md` and `/packet_receiving.md`: Rely on hardware interfaces to physically send and receive data, with protocol selection influenced by flags like ML-based protocol choice (Bit 22).
- `/networking/packet_routing.md`: Routes dynamically based on node status, hardware capacity, and advanced features like trust graphs (Bit 26) or interplanetary routing (Bit 40).

### Security Layer
- `/security/encryption.md`, `/key_management.md`: Use HSMs for secure cryptographic operations, with support for quantum-resistant algorithms (e.g., Kyber, Dilithium) when the quantum-ready signature flag (Bit 39) is enabled.
- Ensures encryption and decryption are optimized for both security and hardware constraints.

### Compression Layer
- `/compression/compression.md`: Supports hardware acceleration (e.g., using GPU) for efficient data compression, with extended compression methods like zlib or Brotli available when Bit 24 is set.

## Use Cases

This architecture is especially relevant for:
- Intermittent or DTN environments (e.g., interplanetary mesh, disaster zones)
- Energy-constrained IoT networks
- Secure, resilient mesh communication in untrusted zones (e.g., Use Cases 5.15, 5.16)
- Interplanetary communication (e.g., Use Case 5.1.1: Mars Rover Data Relay)
- Smart city emergency response systems (e.g., Use Case 5.17)

## Summary

Hardware isn‚Äôt just a backdrop in MeshGuardian‚Äîit‚Äôs a **dynamic partner in protocol execution**. By integrating closely with configuration, monitoring, and security modules, MeshGuardian ensures protocols adapt to real-world constraints in the field. The use of 64-bit capability flags further enhances this adaptability, allowing the system to cater to a wide range of hardware constraints and operational needs, from low-power IoT devices to interplanetary relays.
