# Packet Routing Module

## Purpose
The Routing module calculates the optimal path for data packets from a source node to a destination node in a network. It ensures efficient and reliable packet delivery by selecting routes based on factors like shortest distance or fault tolerance, crucial for dynamic network systems like crisis response or IoT applications.

## Interfaces
- **select_route(source, destination)**  
  - Purpose: Finds the best route from source to destination.  
  - Parameters:  
    - source: Starting node.  
    - destination: Target node.  
  - Returns:  
    - "Local delivery" if source and destination are the same.  
    - List of nodes representing the route if one exists.  
  - Raises:  
    - RoutingError: If no route is available.  

- **find_shortest_path(source, destination)**  
  - Purpose: Computes the shortest path using Dijkstra's algorithm.  
  - Parameters:  
    - source: Starting node.  
    - destination: Target node.  
  - Returns:  
    - List of nodes forming the shortest path.  
    - NULL if no path exists.  

- **update_route_table(new_routes)**  
  - Purpose: Updates the routing table with new route information.  
  - Parameters:  
    - new_routes: New route data.  

- **handle_routing_error(error_type)**  
  - Purpose: Processes routing-related errors.  
  - Parameters:  
    - error_type: Type of error encountered.  

## Depends On
- Network Topology: Provides current node and connection data (e.g., /pseudo-code/networking/topology.md).  
- Routing Exceptions: Defines errors like RoutingError (e.g., /pseudo-code/exceptions/routing_errors.md).  
- Utility Functions: Helper functions like distance(node1, node2) (e.g., /pseudo-code/shared/utils.md).  

## Called By
- Packet Sending Module: Uses select_route to determine paths (e.g., /pseudo-code/networking/packet_sending.md).  
- Network Management Module: Calls update_route_table to refresh routes (e.g., /pseudo-code/networking/network_management.md).  
- Communication Manager: Relies on handle_routing_error for error handling (e.g., /pseudo-code/application_layer/communication_manager.md).  

## Used By
- Packet Sending Module: Depends on this for routing decisions.  
- Network Management Module: Uses it to maintain route consistency.  
- Communication Manager: Integrates it for robust error management.  

## Used In
- Crisis Zone Supply Tracking: Ensures multi-hop routing in unstable networks.  
- Real-Time Disaster Messaging: Guarantees fast, reliable message delivery.  

## Pseudocode
```pseudo-code
// Actual Pseudo-code Implementation
FUNCTION select_route(source, destination)
    IF source == destination
        RETURN "Local delivery"
    ELSE
        route = CALL find_shortest_path(source, destination)
        IF route IS NOT NULL
            RETURN route
        ELSE
            RAISE RoutingError("No route found")

FUNCTION find_shortest_path(source, destination)
    SET distances TO dictionary with all nodes set to infinity
    SET distances[source] TO 0
    SET previous TO dictionary with all nodes set to null
    SET unvisited TO set of all nodes

    WHILE unvisited IS NOT EMPTY
        current = node in unvisited with smallest distance
        IF current == destination
            BREAK
        REMOVE current from unvisited
        FOR each neighbor of current
            IF neighbor in unvisited
                tentative_distance = distances[current] + distance(current, neighbor)
                IF tentative_distance < distances[neighbor]
                    SET distances[neighbor] TO tentative_distance
                    SET previous[neighbor] TO current

    path = []
    current = destination
    WHILE current IS NOT NULL
        INSERT current at beginning of path
        current = previous[current]

    IF path[0] == source
        RETURN path
    ELSE
        RETURN NULL

FUNCTION update_route_table(new_routes)
    // Logic to update routing table with new_routes
    PASS

FUNCTION handle_routing_error(error_type)
    // Logic to handle specified error_type
    PASS

```

## Notes
- Algorithm: find_shortest_path uses Dijkstra's algorithm with O(V^2) time complexity (V = number of nodes). A priority queue could improve this to O(E + V log V), where E is the number of edges.  
- Error Handling: select_route raises RoutingError for invalid routes; callers must handle this via handle_routing_error.  
- Placeholders: update_route_table and handle_routing_error are stubs and need system-specific implementations.  
- Customization: Adjust distance(node1, node2) based on network metrics (e.g., latency, bandwidth).
