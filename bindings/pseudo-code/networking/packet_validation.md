# Validation Module

## Purpose
The Validation module is designed to ensure that data packets conform to specific standards before they are processed or transmitted. It performs checks for required fields, validates key attributes like source and destination, and enforces constraints such as maximum data size. This module plays a critical role in maintaining data integrity and preventing errors in applications like secure messaging or crisis communication systems.

## Interfaces
- **validate_packet(packet)**  
  - Purpose: Validates the overall structure and content of a packet.  
  - Parameters:  
    - packet: The data packet to validate.  
  - Returns:  
    - True if the packet passes all validation checks.  
  - Raises:  
    - ValidationError: If any validation check fails.  

- **has_required_fields(packet)**  
  - Purpose: Ensures the packet includes all mandatory fields.  
  - Parameters:  
    - packet: The packet to inspect.  
  - Returns:  
    - True if all required fields are present, False otherwise.  

- **is_valid_source(source)**  
  - Purpose: Checks the validity of the packet’s source field.  
  - Parameters:  
    - source: The source identifier to validate.  
  - Returns:  
    - True if the source is valid, False otherwise.  

- **is_valid_destination(destination)**  
  - Purpose: Checks the validity of the packet’s destination field.  
  - Parameters:  
    - destination: The destination identifier to validate.  
  - Returns:  
    - True if the destination is valid, False otherwise.  

- **check_constraints(data, rules)**  
  - Purpose: Applies a set of predefined validation rules to the packet data.  
  - Parameters:  
    - data: The data to validate.  
    - rules: A collection of rules to enforce.  
  - Returns:  
    - True if all rules are satisfied.  
  - Raises:  
    - ConstraintViolation: If any rule is violated.  

- **report_validation_errors(errors)**  
  - Purpose: Handles or logs validation errors for further action.  
  - Parameters:  
    - errors: A list of validation errors to process.  

## Depends On
- Validation Exceptions: Defines custom errors like ValidationError and ConstraintViolation (e.g., from a file like /pseudo-code/exceptions/validation_errors.md).  
- Shared Constants: Uses constants such as MAX_PACKET_SIZE (e.g., from /pseudo-code/shared/constants.md).  

## Called By
- Packet Receiving Module: Validates incoming packets before further processing.  
- Packet Sending Module: Ensures packets are valid before they are sent.  

## Used By
- Packet Receiving Module: Relies on this module for incoming data validation.  
- Packet Sending Module: Uses this to verify outgoing packets.  

## Used In
- Secure Communication Systems: Maintains data integrity in critical scenarios like crisis zones.  
- Data Processing Pipelines: Ensures only valid data is processed or stored.  


## Pseudocode

```pseudo-code
// Pseudo-code Implementation
FUNCTION validate_packet(packet)
    // Check if packet has all required fields
    IF NOT has_required_fields(packet)
        RAISE ValidationError("Missing required fields")
    
    // Validate individual fields
    IF NOT is_valid_source(packet.source)
        RAISE ValidationError("Invalid source")
    IF NOT is_valid_destination(packet.destination)
        RAISE ValidationError("Invalid destination")
    
    // Check data size against maximum allowed
    IF size_of(packet.data) > MAX_PACKET_SIZE
        RAISE ValidationError("Data exceeds maximum size")
    
    // Additional validation checks can be added as needed
    RETURN True

FUNCTION has_required_fields(packet)
    // List of required fields in a valid packet
    required_fields = ["source", "destination", "data"]
    FOR each field IN required_fields
        IF field NOT IN packet
            RETURN False
    RETURN True

FUNCTION is_valid_source(source)
    // Placeholder for logic to validate source field
    RETURN True

FUNCTION is_valid_destination(destination)
    // Placeholder for logic to validate destination field
    RETURN True

FUNCTION check_constraints(data, rules)
    // Apply each validation rule to the data
    FOR each rule IN rules
        IF NOT rule(data)
            RAISE ConstraintViolation("Failed rule: " + rule.name)
    RETURN True

FUNCTION report_validation_errors(errors)
    // Log or process each validation error
    FOR each error IN errors
        LOG(error)
```

## Notes
- Error Handling: Functions like validate_packet raise exceptions that must be caught by the calling code.  
- Extensibility: The list of required fields and validation rules can be customized based on system needs.  
- Placeholders: is_valid_source and is_valid_destination are stubs; specific validation logic should be added as required.  
- Performance: Validation is currently linear with respect to fields and rules; optimization may be needed for large datasets.
