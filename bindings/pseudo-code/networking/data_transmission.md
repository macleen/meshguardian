# Data Transmission Module

## Purpose
The Data Transmission module manages the sending and receiving of data packets across the MeshGuardian network, ensuring reliable and efficient communication in Delay-Tolerant Networks (DTNs). It handles packet transmission, retransmission, priority scheduling, and supports ML-driven protocol selection (Bit 13), failure prediction (Bit 14), blockchain audit logging (Bit 15), and Asynchronous Delay-Tolerant Consensus (ADTC) vote transmission for interplanetary environments with 15-30 minute RTTs. The module integrates with the audit trail to log transmission events, aligning with the systemâ€™s zero-trust security model and transparency requirements.

## Depends On

- /pseudo-code/networking/packet.md: Provides the Packet class for structuring data packets.
- /pseudo-code/audit/audit_trail.md: Logs transmission and receipt events.
- /pseudo-code/shared/helpers.md: Provides utility functions for node ID retrieval and timeout management.
- /pseudo-code/shared/constants.md: Uses MAX_PACKET_SIZE and DEFAULT_TIMEOUT for transmission constraints.
- /pseudo-code/networking/packet_buffering.md: Buffers packets during high-latency periods.

## Called By
- **/pseudo-code/networking/packet_sending.md**: Initiates packet transmission.
- **/pseudo-code/networking/packet_receiving.md**: Processes received packets.
- **/pseudo-code/consensus.md**: Sends ADTC votes.

## Used In
- **Use Case 5.15: Aid Relays**: Facilitates multi-hop supply tracking in crisis zones.  
- **Use Case 5.16: Emergency Chat**: Enables real-time disaster messaging with priority scheduling.
- **Use Case 5.1.1: Mars Rover Data Relay**: Transmits ADTC votes in high-latency networks.

## Pseudocode
The constants are defined as immutable values that can be accessed throughout the system. They are grouped here for clarity and ease of maintenance.

## Notes
- Priority Scheduling: High-priority packets (e.g., emergency profile) are transmitted first, logged as Tier 1 events when Bit 15 = 1.
- Reliability: Retransmission attempts (up to DEFAULT_RETRY_LIMIT) for non-ADTC packets; ADTC votes are buffered for opportunistic forwarding.
- Blockchain Audit: Critical transmission/receipt events, including ADTC votes, are logged to Solana (Tier 1) if Bit 15 = 1; standard events use local P2P sync (Tier 2).
- ADTC Support: Handles ADTC vote transmission with extended timeouts (ADTC_TIMEOUT) and buffering, logging vector clock and weight metadata.
- ML Integration: Supports ML-driven protocol selection (Bit 13) and failure prediction (Bit 14) via capability flags.

## TODO
- Implement adaptive retransmission strategies based on network conditions.
- Add support for packet fragmentation for large payloads.
- Optimize ADTC vote buffering for low-bandwidth interplanetary networks.
