# Pseudocode: Packet Buffering

## Purpose
The packet buffering module is designed to temporarily store data packets in a networking system. Its primary purpose is to manage the flow of packets, preventing loss during network congestion, ensuring reliable delivery, and smoothing out differences in data rates between senders and receivers. This module exists to maintain system stability and performance, especially in scenarios where network conditions fluctuate, such as high-traffic periods or intermittent connectivity.

## Interfaces
This module provides the following key functions to interact with the packet buffer:
- **`enqueue(packet)`**: Adds a packet to the buffer.
- **`dequeue()`**: Removes and returns the next packet from the buffer.
- **`is_full()`**: Returns `True` if the buffer has reached its maximum capacity, `False` otherwise.
- **`is_empty()`**: Returns `True` if the buffer contains no packets, `False` otherwise.
- **`size()`**: Returns the current number of packets in the buffer.
- **`flush()`**: Removes all packets from the buffer.

These functions allow other parts of the system to efficiently manage packet storage and retrieval.

## Depends On
This module relies on the following components:
- **`/pseudo-code/networking/packet_creation.md`**: Uses the `PacketCreator` class to generate structured packets for buffering.
- **`/pseudo-code/exceptions/networking_errors.md`**: Depends on error classes like `BufferOverflowError` to handle cases where the buffer cannot accept more packets.
- **`/pseudo-code/shared/constants.md`**: Uses predefined constants, such as `MAX_BUFFER_SIZE`, to set the buffer’s capacity limits.

## Called By
The packet buffering module is utilized by:
- **`/pseudo-code/networking/packet_sending.md`**: Buffers outgoing packets before they are transmitted over the network.
- **`/pseudo-code/networking/packet_receiving.md`**: Stores incoming packets before they are processed or validated.
- **`/pseudo-code/networking/packet_routing.md`**: Holds packets temporarily during routing decisions in complex network paths.

## Used In
This module is referenced in the following use cases:
- **Use Case 5.15**: Aid relays – Buffers packets to prevent loss during unreliable network conditions in emergency zones.
- **Use Case 5.16**: Emergency chat – Manages packet flow to ensure real-time communication during high-traffic disaster scenarios.

## Pseudocode
```pseudocode
CLASS PacketBuffer
    METHOD initialize(max_size)
        /*
        Sets up the buffer with a specified maximum size.

        Parameters:
            max_size: Integer defining the maximum number of packets the buffer can hold.
        */
        buffer = NEW Queue()
        self.max_size = max_size

    METHOD enqueue(packet)
        /*
        Adds a packet to the end of the buffer.

        Parameters:
            packet: The packet to add.

        Raises:
            BufferOverflowError: If the buffer is already full.
        */
        IF size() >= self.max_size
            RAISE BufferOverflowError("Cannot add packet: buffer is full")
        ELSE
            ADD packet to buffer

    METHOD dequeue()
        /*
        Removes and returns the packet at the front of the buffer.

        Returns:
            The next packet, or null if the buffer is empty.
        */
        IF is_empty()
            RETURN null
        ELSE
            RETURN REMOVE first packet from buffer

    METHOD is_full()
        /*
        Checks if the buffer is at capacity.

        Returns:
            True if full, False otherwise.
        */
        RETURN size() >= self.max_size

    METHOD is_empty()
        /*
        Checks if the buffer has no packets.

        Returns:
            True if empty, False otherwise.
        */
        RETURN size() == 0

    METHOD size()
        /*
        Returns the current number of packets in the buffer.

        Returns:
            Integer representing the buffer’s occupancy.
        */
        RETURN length of buffer

    METHOD flush()
        /*
        Empties the buffer by removing all packets.
        */
        CLEAR buffer
```

## Notes
- Edge Cases: Handle buffer overflow by raising BufferOverflowError and return null for dequeue() on an empty buffer.
- Performance: Aim for O(1) time complexity for enqueue and dequeue operations; monitor memory usage under high load.
- Thread Safety: Consider adding locks or semaphores for concurrent access by multiple threads.
- Future Enhancements: Explore priority-based queuing for critical packets and timeout mechanisms to discard stale packets.
