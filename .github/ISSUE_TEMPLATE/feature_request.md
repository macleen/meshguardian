## Feature Request

Thank you for suggesting a feature for MeshGuardian! Please provide a clear and detailed proposal to help us understand your idea and its impact on our decentralized, resilient mesh networking protocol for terrestrial and interplanetary scenarios. Refer to our [CONTRIBUTING.md](../CONTRIBUTING.md), [Code of Conduct](../CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md), and full documentation at [https://meshguardian.com/docs](https://meshguardian.com/docs) for guidelines.

### Feature Title
Provide a concise, descriptive title for the feature.

**Example**: "Add QUIC Protocol Plugin to Pluggable Protocol Engine"

### Description
Describe the feature in detail, including:
- The problem it solves or the enhancement it provides.
- How it benefits MeshGuardian (e.g., improves performance, security, or usability).
- The scope (e.g., specific module, protocol, or use case like crisis zones or Mars missions).

**Example**: 
The QUIC protocol could enhance MeshGuardian’s terrestrial communication by offering low-latency, encrypted transport for high-bandwidth scenarios. This would complement existing protocols like LoRa and DTN Bundle Protocol, enabling faster data transfers in urban disaster recovery zones while maintaining zero-trust security.

### Use Case
Explain the specific scenario or application where this feature would be valuable. Reference relevant use cases from `docs/` (e.g., `space_and_interplanetary_communication.blade.php` for interplanetary missions).

**Example**: 
In a disaster recovery operation (Use Case 5.15: Aid Relays), QUIC could enable rapid transmission of supply tracking data between relief centers, improving coordination compared to LoRa’s lower data rate.

### Technical Considerations
Outline any technical details or constraints, such as:
- Hardware requirements (e.g., CPU, RAM, power consumption; see `compression.md`, `pbft_validation.md`).
- Impact on existing features (e.g., consensus in `pbft_validation.md`, multi-blockchain logging in `audit_trail.md`, slashing logic in `pos_validation.md`).
- Dependencies or new modules needed (e.g., updates to `constants.md`).
- Potential challenges (e.g., compatibility with low-power devices, interplanetary latency).
- Alignment with the 64-bit capability flags structure (e.g., Bit 39 for Quantum Mode, Bit 36 for extended compression; see `protocol-specs/capability_flags.md`).

**Example**: 
- QUIC requires a 32 MHz CPU and 64 KB RAM, suitable for moderate-capability devices (Device Capability Level 1).
- May need a new protocol ID in `constants.md` and integration with the Pluggable Protocol Engine in `bindings/pseudo-code/networking/`.
- Challenges include ensuring QUIC’s encryption aligns with post-quantum cryptography (Bit 39, QUANTUM_FLAG) and maintaining compatibility with Low-Energy Mode (Bit 24) for low-power devices.
- Consider impact on multi-blockchain logging (Bit 37) for audit trail enhancements.

### References
Link to relevant documentation or issues:
- Project files (e.g., `bindings/pseudo-code/adaptive_protocol_selection.md`, `docs/space_and_interplanetary_communication.blade.php`, `protocol-specs/capability_flags.md`).
- Related issues or pull requests (e.g., #123).
- External resources (e.g., QUIC specification, TinyML research).

**Example**: 
- See `bindings/pseudo-code/adaptive_protocol_selection.md` for protocol selection criteria.
- See `protocol-specs/capability_flags.md` for 64-bit capability flags assignments.
- Related to #456 (TinyML optimization for protocol selection).
- QUIC specification: https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc9000

### Additional Context
Provide any other details, such as:
- Prior discussions in the [Discussions tab](https://github.com/macleen/meshguardian/discussions).
- Mockups, diagrams, or code snippets.
- Community feedback from Matrix, IPFS, or SpaceTech Slack.

**Example**: 
Discussed in Matrix #decentralized:matrix.org as a potential enhancement for urban mesh networks. Preliminary pseudocode:
```pseudo-code
FUNCTION add_quic_plugin()
    protocol_id = constants.QUIC_CODE
    CALL pluggable_engine.register(protocol_id, quic_driver)
END FUNCTION
```
