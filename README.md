**Resilient, secure, and modular mesh networking protocol for Delay-Tolerant Networks (DTNs), disaster zones, and interplanetary systems.**

[Full documentation available at https://meshguardian.com](https://meshguardian.com/docs)

MeshGuardian is a next-generation protocol stack designed to keep communication alive—even when everything else fails. Built for the harshest environments, from offline villages and war zones to deep space networks, it brings trust, synchronization, and performance to where traditional internet protocols fall apart.

## 🌐 Key Features

- 🔁 **Delay-Tolerant Synchronization**  
  Reliable nano-sync, offline buffering, stream ordering, and audit-backed consistency across disconnected nodes.

- 🔒 **End-to-End Security**  
  AES-256, Schnorr signatures, optional post-quantum crypto (Kyber/Dilithium), blockchain-based audit trails.

- 🔄 **Adaptive Consensus Engine**  
  Hybrid PoS/PBFT validation based on network size, energy mode, and data priority.

- 🧩 **Pluggable Protocol Engine**  
  Swap in new transport, encryption, or logging modules at runtime without reconfiguration.

- ⚡ **Energy-Aware & Edge-Ready**  
  Designed for IoT, drones, smart dust, and low-power embedded nodes.

- 🌍 **Multi-Cluster & Cross-Region Support**  
  Routes data securely across isolated clusters using relay-aware packet composition.

## 🧠 Use Cases

- 🚨 Emergency communications in disaster response zones
- 🛰️ Interplanetary data relays between ground stations and satellites
- 🔐 Secure voting and audit logging in off-grid governance systems
- 🧑‍🤝‍🧑 Peer-to-peer coordination in rural or conflict-stricken regions
- 🌲 Wildlife or environmental sensor swarms across vast terrains

## 🧬 Protocol Architecture

| Segment   | Size         | Description |
|-----------|--------------|-------------|
| Header    | 128 bytes    | Routing, identity, protocol flags, time, sync, encryption, plugin data |
| Payload   | Variable     | Compressed & encrypted data (e.g., JSON, telemetry, logs) |
| Trailer   | 96 bytes     | Signature + Audit Trail Hash |

> 📐 Example total packet size: 491 bytes

## 🔌 Multi-Language SDKs

MeshGuardian supports SDKs in many popular languages—each with its own entry point in the `/bindings` directory:

```
/bindings/
├── c/
├── csharp/
├── python/
├── java/
├── go/
├── javascript/
├── php/
├── rust/
```

Each SDK is modular, independently testable, and installable via its native package manager.

## 📦 Examples

Usage samples are available in `/examples/`:

- 🔧 `examples/python/`: Encrypt, sign, and sync a packet
- 📡 `examples/c/`: Build and transmit compressed telemetry
- 🛰️ `examples/go/`: Cross-cluster routing with PBFT sync
