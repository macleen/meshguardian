# 5. Security Basics in MeshGuardian

MeshGuardian is built from the ground up to support **secure communication** in hostile or disconnected environments. This document introduces the foundational security principles and modules in the system, leveraging 64-bit capability flags for modularity (see `/protocol-specs/capability_flags.md`).

Whether youâ€™re deploying in a rural IoT network or a disaster zone, these basics ensure **confidentiality, integrity, and trust**.

## Core Security Modules

MeshGuardian separates security into dedicated submodules, enabled by 64-bit capability flags (e.g., Bit 39 for post-quantum cryptography):

| Module                          | Role                                  |
|----------------------------------|----------------------------------------|
| `/security/encryption.md`       | Handles encryption/decryption of packets |
| `/security/key_management.md`   | Manages cryptographic keys lifecycle    |
| `/security/privacy_safe_pod.md` | Protects identity and location metadata |
| `/security/zkp.md`              | Verifies data ownership without revealing content |

> **Note**: Security in MeshGuardian is not optionalâ€”itâ€™s deeply integrated with networking, device, and protocol layers via capability flags.

## Encryption Workflow

### Before Sending
1. The payload (`packet.data`) is **compressed** (e.g., zlib or Brotli via Bit 36) and **encrypted** with a key from the key management module, using post-quantum algorithms if enabled (Bit 39).
2. Headers may be encrypted in "confidential" profiles (e.g., `"profile": "telehealth"`).

### On Receive
1. The system checks **packet authenticity** using signatures (e.g., Dilithium via Bit 39).
2. If valid, it **decrypts the data** using the correct key.

- `/security/key_management.md`

## Key Generation and Storage

- Keys are generated using `generate_key()` with secure parameters.
- Keys are stored via `store_key()` in secure vaults or Hardware Security Modules (HSMs).
- Rotate or revoke keys with:
  ```python
  rotate_key(key_id, new_parameters)
  revoke_key(key_id)
  ```

  ðŸ”„ Regular key rotation is encouraged for forward secrecy and trust management.

Authentication & Nonce Protection  
To prevent replay attacks, MeshGuardian uses:
-- Timestamp validation
-- Optional nonce
-- Rate-limiting and IP lockout on repeated failures
-- Audit logging of security events (Bit 37 for multi-blockchain logging)  

See /security/auth.md for details.

Privacy Safe Pods (Optional)
For high-privacy deployments:

-- Nodes are placed into privacy-safe enclaves.
-- Identity, geolocation, and timing metadata are obfuscated.
-- Useful in civil society or protest use cases.  

See /security/privacy_safe_pod.md.

**Tips for Developers**
- Use derive_key() from /security/secure_key_derivation.md instead of storing passphrases
- Validate all inputs and hash passwords with bcrypt or argon2
- Never store private keys in plaintextâ€”even during debugging
- Enable encryption_required=true in packet headers for sensitive profiles
- Summary

## Software-Hardware Alignment
Configure 64-bit capability flags in config.py to enable security features like post-quantum cryptography (Bit 39) or audit logging (Bit 37) for optimal operation (see /protocol-specs/capability_flags.md).
