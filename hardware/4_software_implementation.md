# Software Implementation for MeshGuardian Node

## Purpose
The software implementation of the MeshGuardian node is responsible for managing all mesh networking tasks, including packet creation, routing, and communication with other nodes. It ensures that the node can participate effectively in the mesh network, providing reliable data transmission even in challenging environments.

## Interfaces
- **Function:** `initialize_software()`  
  Sets up the software environment, loads configurations, and prepares the node for operation.  
- **Function:** `start_mesh_service()`  
  Starts the mesh networking service, enabling the node to send and receive packets.  
- **Function:** `handle_packet(packet)`  
  Processes incoming packets and determines the appropriate action (e.g., forwarding, processing locally).  

## Depends On
- **/pseudo-code/device/hardware_interface.md**: For interacting with the hardware components.  
- **/pseudo-code/shared/constants.md**: For accessing system-wide constants.  
- **/pseudo-code/networking/packet_creation.md**: For creating packets according to the protocol.  
- **/protocol-specs/capability_flags.md**: For defining 64-bit capability flags used in configuration and packet processing.

## Called By
- Startup scripts or services that initialize the node on boot.  
- User commands to manually start or stop the mesh service.  

## Used In
- **Use Case 5.15: Aid Relays**: Manages communication for supply tracking in crisis zones.  
- **Use Case 5.16: Emergency Chat**: Facilitates real-time messaging in disaster scenarios.  

## Pseudocode
```pseudocode
// Function to initialize the software
FUNCTION initialize_software()
    LOAD_CONFIGURATION(config.py)  // Includes 64-bit capability flags (e.g., Bit 23, Bit 39)
    VALIDATE_CAPABILITY_FLAGS()    // Ensure flags align with protocol-specs/capability_flags.md
    INIT_HARDWARE()
    SETUP_NETWORK_INTERFACES()
    RETURN success_status

// Function to start the mesh networking service
FUNCTION start_mesh_service()
    WHILE True
        LISTEN_FOR_PACKETS()
        IF packet_received THEN
            CALL handle_packet(packet)
        END IF
        // Additional logic for sending packets, maintaining connections, etc.

// Function to handle an incoming packet
FUNCTION handle_packet(packet)
    CHECK_CAPABILITY_FLAGS(packet.header)  // Apply settings like compression (Bit 36) or encryption (Bit 39)
    IF packet.destination == local_node THEN
        PROCESS_PACKET_LOCALLY(packet)
    ELSE
        FORWARD_PACKET(packet)
    END IF
```

## Notes
- **Performance**: Ensure the software is optimized for low-latency operations, especially in real-time communication scenarios.  
- **Security**: Implement encryption and authentication mechanisms to protect data integrity and confidentiality.  
- **Scalability**: Design the software to handle a growing number of nodes and increased network traffic.  
- **Capability Flags**: Use 64-bit capability flags to enable features like Low-Energy Mode (Bit 23), multi-blockchain logging (Bit 37), or node degradation (Bit 38); see protocol-specs/capability_flags.md.  

- **TODO**: Add support for dynamic routing algorithms to improve network resilience.
