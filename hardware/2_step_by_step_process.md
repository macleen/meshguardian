## 1. Prepare the Raspberry Pi

### Flash the Operating System
- Download **Raspberry Pi OS** (formerly Raspbian).
- Use [Raspberry Pi Imager](https://www.raspberrypi.com/software/) to flash the image onto a **microSD card**.

> ðŸ’¡ **Tip**: Use the "Lite" version for a minimal setup if youâ€™re comfortable with command-line interfaces.

### Insert the MicroSD Card
- Place the flashed microSD card into the Raspberry Pi.

### Connect Peripherals (Optional)
- Attach a monitor, keyboard, and mouse for the initial setup.
- Alternatively, enable **SSH** for headless remote access.

### Power On
- Connect the power supply to boot the Raspberry Pi.

## 2. Initial Configuration

### Update the System
Open a terminal and run:
```bash
    sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade
```
Enable Necessary Interfaces
Use the configuration tool:
```bash
    sudo raspi-config
```
Navigate to Interfacing Options and enable interfaces like GPIO, I2C, or SPI, as required by your wireless module.

## 3. Assemble the Hardware
Attach the Wireless Module
Connect your LoRa HAT or other wireless module to the Raspberry Piâ€™s GPIO pins.

Refer to the moduleâ€™s documentation for exact pin layout.

Optional â€“ Add Battery Pack  
For off-grid operation, connect a battery pack to the Raspberry Piâ€™s power input.  

Place in Case  
Enclose the setup in a protective case to shield against dust, moisture, or impact.

## 4. Configure the Wireless Module
Install Drivers  
For LoRa or similar modules, run:
```bash
    sudo apt install python3-pip
    pip3 install RPi.GPIO
```
Follow any additional setup steps in the moduleâ€™s documentation.

Set Parameters  
Configure frequency bands, power levels, and regional compliance settings.  
This may involve editing configuration files or running setup scripts.  

## 5. Install MeshGuardian Software
Clone the Repository  
```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-repo/meshguardian.git
```    
Replace the URL with the actual MeshGuardian repository.  
Install Dependencies  
```bash
    cd meshguardian
    pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```
Configure the Software  
Edit the configuration files to match your hardware setup and network   environment.  
  
Follow guidance in the /pseudo-code/ folder for protocol, security, and device logic.

## 6. Set Up Auto-Start (Optional)
Enable on Boot  
Edit rc.local:
```bash
    sudo nano /etc/rc.local
```
Add your software start command before exit 0. 
Alternatively, create a custom systemd service for better control.

## 7. Reboot and Verify
Reboot the System  
```bash
    sudo reboot
```
Check Services  
Confirm that the MeshGuardian software runs at startup.  

Ensure the wireless module is active and transmitting as expected.  
Use logs or diagnostics tools for troubleshooting.
