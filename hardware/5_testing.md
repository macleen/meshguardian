# ðŸ§ª Testing for MeshGuardian Node

## Purpose
The testing module ensures the **functionality**, **reliability**, and **resilience** of a MeshGuardian node. It verifies correct behavior under normal operations, edge cases, and failure conditions. This module plays a critical role in maintaining the overall robustness and trustworthiness of the mesh network.

---

## Interfaces

- **`run_unit_tests()`**  
  Executes a suite of unit tests to validate individual components and functions.

- **`run_integration_tests()`**  
  Runs tests across multiple modules to ensure interoperability and data flow.

- **`simulate_failure_scenarios()`**  
  Emulates various failure scenarios to evaluate the nodeâ€™s response, fallback mechanisms, and recovery.

---

## Depends On

- [`/pseudo-code/shared/helpers.md`](../shared/helpers.md):  
  Provides utility functions (e.g., logging, mocking, timers) used in testing procedures.

- [`/pseudo-code/exceptions/base_exception.md`](../exceptions/base_exception.md):  
  Supplies the foundational error handling classes used in test assertions.

---

## Called By

- **Developers and QA teams** during development and validation stages.
- **Automated CI/CD pipelines** for continuous integration and regression testing.

---

## Used In

- **Use Case 5.15 â€“ Aid Relays:**  
  Validates consistent packet relays for critical supply tracking in disaster zones.

- **Use Case 5.16 â€“ Emergency Chat:**  
  Ensures real-time communication functions properly under stress and variable network quality.

## Pseudocode

```pseudocode
// Function to run unit tests
FUNCTION run_unit_tests()
    FOR each test IN unit_test_suite
        EXECUTE_TEST(test)
        IF test.failed THEN
            LOG_FAILURE(test)
        END IF
    END FOR
    RETURN test_results

// Function to run integration tests
FUNCTION run_integration_tests()
    FOR each test IN integration_test_suite
        EXECUTE_TEST(test)
        IF test.failed THEN
            LOG_FAILURE(test)
        END IF
    END FOR
    RETURN test_results

// Function to simulate failure scenarios
FUNCTION simulate_failure_scenarios()
    FOR each scenario IN failure_scenarios
        SIMULATE_FAILURE(scenario)
        CHECK_SYSTEM_RESPONSE()
        IF response NOT AS expected THEN
            LOG_ANOMALY(scenario)
        END IF
    END FOR
    RETURN simulation_results
```

## Notes
âœ… Test Coverage
Ensure tests cover all critical paths, boundary conditions, and security-sensitive logic.

- Automation
Integrate this module into CI/CD pipelines for automated, repeatable testing on every push or merge.

- Performance Testing
Include stress tests to analyze system behavior under high load or constrained conditions.

## TODO
Implement mock hardware interfaces to simulate physical environments without real-world deployment.  

Add fuzz testing for input validation.  

Benchmark CPU, memory, and wireless throughput under peak usage.
