# Building a MeshGuardian Node Using Raspberry Pi

MeshGuardian is designed to provide secure, resilient communication in environments with limited or no traditional connectivity—such as rural areas, disaster zones, or crisis response deployments. One of the key ways to deploy MeshGuardian is by using a Raspberry Pi as a physical node in a mesh network.

This guide walks you through everything you need to build, configure, and deploy your own MeshGuardian node using readily available hardware components and open-source software.
