## ✅ Required Components

### 📦 Raspberry Pi
- **Recommended:** Raspberry Pi 4 — ideal for high-performance tasks and complex routing.
- **Alternative:** Raspberry Pi Zero 2W — suitable for low-power, lightweight setups.

### ⚡ Power Supply
- **For Raspberry Pi 4:** USB-C power adapter (5V, 3A).
- **For Raspberry Pi Zero 2W:** Micro-USB power adapter (5V, 2.5A).

### 💾 MicroSD Card
- **Minimum:** Class 10, 16GB or greater.
- **Recommendation:** Use a high-quality brand to ensure reliability and prevent data corruption.

### 📡 Wireless Communication Module
- A **LoRa HAT** or other compatible wireless module (e.g., Zigbee) depending on your use case.
- Ensure compatibility with your Raspberry Pi model and desired communication protocol.

### 🧱 Case
- A **protective enclosure** to house the Raspberry Pi and wireless hardware—especially critical for field deployments.

### 🔋 Optional: Battery Pack
- A **portable power source** (USB battery bank or solar solution) for off-grid, mobile, or emergency deployment scenarios.

## 💡 Notes and Recommendations

### Raspberry Pi Selection
- Use **Raspberry Pi 4** for performance-intensive deployments (e.g., multi-hop routing, real-time communication).
- Use **Raspberry Pi Zero 2W** for lightweight, energy-efficient scenarios with fewer responsibilities.

### Wireless Module
- Choose based on your **network requirements** (range, power, bandwidth).
- **LoRa** is preferred for long-range, low-power communication.
- Verify compatibility with both the **hardware** and **MeshGuardian software stack**.

### Power Supply
- Use certified power supplies with **correct voltage and amperage** to avoid system instability or potential hardware damage.

### MicroSD Card
- Prioritize durability and reliability (e.g., Samsung, SanDisk, Kingston).
- Larger capacity (32GB+) is recommended for logs, updates, and local caching.

### Case
- Ensure the case provides protection against **dust, shock, and moisture**—especially for outdoor or semi-permanent deployments.

### Battery Pack
- For remote deployments, choose a battery pack with:
  - **High capacity** (e.g., 10,000mAh+).
  - **Solar charging** capabilities (optional but ideal).
  - **Stable output voltage** to prevent brownouts or resets.
