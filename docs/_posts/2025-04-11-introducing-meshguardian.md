We’re proud to unveil **MeshGuardian**, a decentralized, protocol-agnostic networking solution built for **Delay-Tolerant Networks (DTNs)**—from natural disaster zones to interplanetary communication relays.

## 🧭 Why We Built MeshGuardian

In moments of crisis, connection is survival.  
Traditional internet infrastructure fails under stress: power outages, collapsed towers, or extreme latency. MeshGuardian was born to provide **trust, synchronization, and data delivery** even when there’s no grid at all.

## 🌐 What Makes MeshGuardian Unique?

- **Nano-sync protocols** for ultra-low-power communication
- **128B headers** packed with routing, encryption, and plugin logic
- **Blockchain-backed audit trails** for tamper-proof integrity
- **Hybrid PoS/PBFT consensus engine** based on data priority
- **Dynamic pluggable engines** for compression, trust graphs, and more

## 🚀 Built for the Harshest Environments

MeshGuardian operates where others can’t:
- 🌋 **Post-disaster zones** with zero infrastructure
- 🛰️ **Planetary bases** and long-delay space links
- 🌐 **Off-grid villages** and rural IoT deployments

## 🤝 Join the Mission

We’re building more than a protocol. We’re building a safety net for those the internet forgot.
