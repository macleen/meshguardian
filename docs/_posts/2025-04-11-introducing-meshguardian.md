Weâ€™re proud to unveil **MeshGuardian**, a decentralized, protocol-agnostic networking solution built for **Delay-Tolerant Networks (DTNs)**â€”from natural disaster zones to interplanetary communication relays.

## Why We Built MeshGuardian

In moments of crisis, connection is survival.  
Traditional internet infrastructure fails under stress: power outages, collapsed towers, or extreme latency. MeshGuardian was born to provide **trust, synchronization, and data delivery** even when thereâ€™s no grid at all.

## What Makes MeshGuardian Unique?

- **Nano-sync protocols** for ultra-low-power communication
- **Compact headers** (21-byte fixed + variable CBOR) with 64-bit capability flags for routing, encryption, and plugin logic
- **Blockchain-backed audit trails** for tamper-proof integrity across multiple blockchains
- **Hybrid PoS/PBFT/ADTC consensus engine** based on data priority
- **Dynamic pluggable engines** for compression, trust graphs, post-quantum cryptography, and more

## Built for the Harshest Environments

MeshGuardian operates where others canâ€™t:
- **Post-disaster zones** with zero infrastructure
- **Planetary bases** and long-delay space links
- **Off-grid villages** and rural IoT deployments

## Join the Mission

Weâ€™re building more than a protocol. Weâ€™re building a safety net for those the internet forgot.
